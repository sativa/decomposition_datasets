Incbations:

Incubations were conducted by EC Adair and J Reid in the Hobbie lab at the University of Minnesota. The study was conducted as a part of the larger Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen (BioCON) study at Cedar Creek LTER. More information on BioCON is available here: http://www.biocon.umn.edu/experiments/
The in-lab incubation was conducted from August 25, 2006 - September 27, 2007 (391 days) at 70% field capacity.

Calculations:

Cumulative respiration was calculated as D(t-1)rate + avg[D(t-1),D(t)]*days between samplings+D(t)rate

These data were used in: Reid, J., E.C. Adair, S.E. Hobbie and P.B. Reich. 2012. Biodiversity, nitrogen deposition and CO2 affect grassland soil carbon cycling but not storage. Ecosystems. 15:580-590.
