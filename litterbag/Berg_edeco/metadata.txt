Data summary:

Data were collected by Bjorn Berg at 47 sites across Europe, using 16 leaf litter types that were decomposed both above and belowground. In field decomposition experiments ranged from 2 to 8 years in length.

Climate data (MAP and MAT) are from the CRU database. No replicates are available for these data.
