Data summary:

Data were collected by J Powers and others (Powers et al. 2009) during a one year decomposition experiment at 23 tropical forest locations in North, Central, and South America, Asia, and Africa. The Powers et al. (2009) was a full factorial experiment with two standard leaf litter types, two fauna treatments (include or exclude fauna), and two decomposition environments (above or belowground). Fauna include treatments used 2mm mesh bags; fauna exclude treatments used 25 micrometer mesh bags. Bags were distributed at the start of the wet season in each site, or when it was convenient at sites without wet seasons (LAS and HAW) during 2002, 2003, and 2005 (ULU only) and were collected at approximately 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 months. There are 1 to 3 replicates per site x treatment and sampling time, depending on missing bags. 17% of initial mass remained on average at the last collection.

Climate data were provided for most by the manuscript (site averages from published or unpublished data). Climate data for all sites for the study period (2002-2003) are also provided from the CRU database.
