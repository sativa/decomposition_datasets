This is the main public repository for a meta-data study collecting data sets related to soil and litter decompositon. Each study has it's own folder which will include:

* `README.txt` - meta-information on the study including links to archive repository, links to manuscripts associated with the original publication, contact for the study (if applicable), and other comments.
* `authorYYYYdatatype/` directories contain data files in their original format
* `processData.Rmd` - an Rmarkdown document which processes the orginal data files into a long format csv file (`processedData.csv`) with the specifications outlined below, including the treatment id key, and includes basic visualizations.

`ProcessedData.csv` will contain the following columns:

* `TreatmentID` - A unique character string that should combine field and incubation treatment information in a moderately intuitive manner. For example: if the soil core in MyStudy was taken from a nitrogen field treatment location and incubated at 15C in the lab 'MyStudy_N_15C' might be used. The key should be defined in the processData text.
* `DateTime` - day and time of the measurement in day in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format 
* `Type` - type of measurement. For example: `CO2_flux` or `SOC`
* `Value` - value of measurement
* `Sd` - standard deviation of aggregated replicates or (preferablly) measurement error standard deviation
* `n` - sample size
* `Unit` - unit of measurement, this should be in standard SI units: kg, day, m
