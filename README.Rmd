This is the main public repository for a meta-data study collecting data sets related to soil and litter decompositon. Each study has it's own folder which will include:

* `README.txt` - meta-information on the study including links to archive repository, links to manuscripts associated with the original publication, contact for the study (if applicable), and other comments.
* `authorYYYYdatatype/` directories contain data files in their original format
* `processData.Rmd` - an Rmarkdown document which processes the orginal data files into a long format csv file (`processedData.csv`) with the specifications outlined below, including the treatment id key, and includes basic visualizations.

`ProcessedData.csv` will contain the following columns:

### Data (time varying)

* study_id
* substrate_id
* elapsed_time # days since initiation
* carbon_flux (g CO2-C / g soil-C_t0 / d)
* carbon_stock (g C / g C_t0)
* percent_water
* temperature (C)

### Substrates (Initial Conditions)

* id
* name
* type (soc, litter, etc)
* study_id
* percent_clay
* percent_lignin
* percent_carbon
* percent_nitrogen

### study

* id
