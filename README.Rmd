This is the main public repository for a meta-data study collecting data sets related to soil and litter decompositon. Each study has it's own folder which will include:

* `README.txt` - meta-information on the study including links to archive repository, links to manuscripts associated with the original publication, contact for the study (if applicable), and other comments.
* `author_YYYY_datatype/` directories contain data files in their original format
* `processData.Rmd` - an Rmarkdown document which processes the orginal data files into 4 long format csv files (`outputs/processedType.csv`) with the specifications outlined below and includes basic visualizations.

The respective csv columns will contain the following columns:

### `ProcessedData.csv` - primary data set for model-data integration

* study_id
* substrate_id
* environment_id
* elapsed_time # days since initiation
* carbon_flux (g CO2-C / g soil-C_t0 / d) # for soil core incubations; NA otherwise
* carbon_stock (g C / g C_t0) # for litterbag studies; NA otherwise

### `ProcessedEnvironmental.csv` - data set for enviromental sensitivity of model-data integration

* environmental_id
* percent_water # precent of field capasity
* temperature (C) # incubation temperature
* MAP (mm) # mean annual precipitation
* MAT (C) # mean annual temperature
* Latitude # location of litterbag site
* Longitude # location of litterbag site

### `ProcessedSubstrates.csv` (Initial Conditions) - data set for enviromental sensitivity of model-data integration

* substrate_id
* type # one of two options: soil or litterbag
* percent_clay
* percent_lignin
* percent_carbon
* percent_nitrogen

### `ProcessedStudy.csv` - data set for study evaluation

* study_id
* author # contact author for data set (or study)
* year # starting year of incubation or litter exposure
* doi # DOI for data set; alternatively DOI for inital manuscript
* method # to measure carbon flux or carbon stock
* volume # litter or soil
* instrument # to measure carbon flux or carbon stock
